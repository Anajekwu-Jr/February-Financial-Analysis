# A Student’s Journey: Uncovering Where the Money Goes

As a student, it’s easy to feel like money just disappears. You don’t spend much in big chunks, but somehow, at the end of the month, the balance is a lot lower than expected. Sound familiar? Well, that’s exactly what happened to me.

For a long time, I had this nagging feeling that my money was draining, but I couldn't put my finger on why. I wasn’t going on wild shopping sprees or spending large sums on anything major. So, where was it all going?

This curiosity led me to take a closer look at my bank statement for February. I decided to go beyond the usual "just checking the balance" and actually *analyze* it down to the smallest detail. I wanted to know *where* my money was going, *how* it was being spent, and *when* it was going out. What I discovered wasn’t just eye-opening—it was a game changer.

## Payment Methods: Transfer is My Go-To
It turns out that 69% of my debits were from transfers. The majority of my spending wasn’t on the ATM or POS, but rather on good old bank transfers. This was a big revelation for me, as I realized I was spending more money through transfers than I thought.

## Small Spends Add Up Fast
I always thought I wasn’t spending a lot of money. And technically, I wasn’t, at least not in big amounts. But what I missed was how often I was making smaller payments. They didn’t seem like much at the time, but when I looked at the overall picture, these little expenses piled up to 68% of my total debits. It’s the little things that drain your account without you even realizing it.

## Weekends: The Hidden Financial Killer
Here’s where things got really interesting. I took a closer look at the days I spent the most money. What I found shocked me. I was spending more on weekends; especially Saturdays and Sundays than on weekdays. Even worse, my weekend spending often exceeded my earnings during the same period. This was a serious wake-up call. It’s clear that if I don’t review this habit, I’m setting myself up for a financial mess.

## What I Spend on Most
The breakdown of my spending revealed another key insight: most of my money was going towards bill payments. Transfers were the second biggest expense, but who I was transferring money to became its own mystery. While I decided to keep that part to myself, it was an important piece of the puzzle.

## The Numbers: What the Stats Say
The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) really put things into perspective. Here’s what the data showed:

- **Total Credit:** 67K
- **Total Debit:** 52K
- **Average Daily Credit:** 6.05K
- **Average Daily Debit:** 4.76K
- **Cashflow:** 14K

These metrics were the foundation of my financial health check. My credit is decent, and my debits are manageable, but the weekend spending imbalance is something that can’t be ignored.

## Reflection and Action
With this dashboard and analysis, I finally got the clarity I was seeking. The numbers weren’t just numbers anymore; they told a story of how my money was moving and more importantly, why I needed to take control. The financial drain was coming from frequent small purchases and weekend spending, two habits that need serious reviewing.

Now that I understand the flow of my finances better, I can make smarter decisions moving forward. And who knows? Maybe I can start making weekends a bit more budget-friendly.
